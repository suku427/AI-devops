Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming **DevOps engineering**, enabling automation, efficiency, and enhanced decision-making. As AI tools become more integrated into the **DevOps landscape**, it's essential for engineers to understand how **Generative AI** and **Traditional AI** can be leveraged to streamline workflows.

**This article introduces:**

•	The difference between **Traditional AI** and **Generative AI**

•	**Large Language Models (LLMs)** and how they work

•	**AI tools** that DevOps engineers should focus on

**•	Real-world AI use cases in DevOps**

•	A **demonstration** of AI-generated DevOps scripts

This is part of the **AI-Assisted DevOps Series**, where we explore how **AI** can enhance various aspects of DevOps.

**Understanding AI in DevOps**

**Traditional AI vs Generative AI**

| **Feature**         | **Traditional AI**                                     | **Generative AI**                                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Use Case** | Prediction & Pattern Recognition                  | Content Generation (Text, Images, Code)     |
| **Example Use Case** | Weather Forecasting, Log Analysis, Auto-Scaling  | Generating Kubernetes Manifests, Code Completion |
| **Training Data**    | Historical Data & Metrics                          | Large-scale datasets from various sources   |


**Use Cases of Traditional AI in DevOps**

Traditional AI is widely used in DevOps for predictive analytics and incident management:

**•	Log Analysis & Anomaly Detection** – AI models analyze logs to predict potential system failures.

**•	Auto-Scaling & Resource Optimization** – AI-based predictive AWS Auto Scaling adjusts resources dynamically.

**•	Incident Management** – AI-driven observability platforms detect and report system anomalies in real time.

**Use Cases of Generative AI in DevOps**

Generative AI automates development and operations tasks:

**•	Kubernetes Manifest Generation** – AI-powered tools like **ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot** can generate Kubernetes YAML files.

**•	Shell Scripting & CI/CD Automation** – AI assists in writing shell scripts for infrastructure automation.

**•	AI-Assisted Documentation** – AI tools generate technical documentation based on code changes.

**Large Language Models (LLMs) in DevOps**

**What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?**

LLMs are a subset of **Generative AI**, designed to generate text-based outputs. These models are trained on billions of parameters using **supercomputers** with thousands of **GPUs and TPUs** for high-speed processing.

**How LLMs Work**

**1.	Training Phase** – Models process vast amounts of **text data** (e.g., open-source repositories, research papers, and documentation).

**2.	Inference Phase** – When queried, the model retrieves responses from its trained knowledge base.

**Examples of LLMs used in DevOps:**

**•	GPT-4, Llama 3, DeepSeek, Claude** – AI-powered assistants for generating code and scripts.

**•	GitHub Copilot, AWS CodeWhisperer** – AI-powered DevOps tools for improving productivity.

**AI Landscape for DevOps Engineers**

To effectively use AI in **DevOps workflows**, engineers should focus on **four key areas:**

**1. AI Chatbots**

**•	ChatGPT (GPT-4)** – Code generation, problem-solving

**•	Claude (Anthropic AI)** – AI-driven documentation

**•	DeepSeek, Run Llama** – Open-source AI alternatives

**2. AI Agents**

**•	GitHub Copilot Workspace** – AI-assisted coding & automation

**•	Bolt.New** – AI agent for DevOps automation

**3. AI Assistants**

**•	GitHub Copilot** – AI-powered code suggestions

**•	Pieces for Developers** – AI-powered code snippet management

**4. Programming & Scripting**

**•	Python (FastAPI, Flask, Django)** – AI model integration

**•	Shell Scripting** – AI-assisted infrastructure automation

**AI-Powered DevOps: A Demonstration**

**Task: AI-Generated Shell Script for VM Health Monitoring**

**Problem Statement**

We will create a **shell script** that:

•	Monitors **CPU, Memory, and Disk Usage** of an **AWS EC2 instance.**

•	Declares the system **healthy** if usage is **below 60%.**

•	Declares the system **unhealthy** if usage exceeds **60%.**

•	Accepts a **command-line argument** (--explain) to provide a detailed explanation.

**Generating the Script Using GitHub Copilot Workspace**

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Function to check VM health
check_health() {
    cpu_usage=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')
    mem_usage=$(free | awk '/Mem:/ {printf("%.2f"), $3/$2 * 100}')
    disk_usage=$(df / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//')

    if (( $(echo "$cpu_usage < 60" | bc -l) )) && 
       (( $(echo "$mem_usage < 60" | bc -l) )) && 
       (( "$disk_usage" -lt 60 )); then
        status="Healthy"
    else
        status="Unhealthy"
    fi

    echo "VM Status: $status"

    if [[ "$1" == "--explain" ]]; then
        echo "CPU Usage: $cpu_usage%"
        echo "Memory Usage: $mem_usage%"
        echo "Disk Usage: $disk_usage%"
    fi
}

# Execute the function
check_health "$1"
```

**Deploying the Script on an AWS EC2 Instance**

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/vm-health-check.git
cd vm-health-check

# Step 2: Make the script executable
chmod +x vm_health.sh

# Step 3: Run the script
./vm_health.sh  # Output: Healthy / Unhealthy
./vm_health.sh --explain  # Output with details
```

**Results**

•	✅ AI successfully generated a working **VM health monitoring script.**

•	✅ The script correctly analyzes **CPU, Memory, and Disk Usage.**

• ✅ The script is **AI-assisted but DevOps engineers must review and debug outputs.**

**Key Takeaways**

**Why AI Matters for DevOps Engineers**

**1.	AI Accelerates Productivity** – Automates repetitive tasks like scripting, YAML generation, and monitoring.

**2.	AI Enhances Decision Making** – Assists in log analysis, anomaly detection, and auto-scaling.

**3.	AI is a Tool, Not a Replacement** – Engineers must understand **DevOps fundamentals** before using AI-driven automation.
